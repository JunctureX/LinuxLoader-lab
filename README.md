```
To get you hands on this project, check `instructions/` for a step-by-step tutorial.

### Evaluate your code
To review your submission as a whole, use:
```bash
# you may have to run it with python3 if python points to python2
python autograder.py
```
To debug individual test case, use:
```bash
python autograder.py test-index
```

### Asking questions

For questions about grading or something else, feel free to shoot me an e-mail.

### Beyond this project
This project is meant to be supportive material for *Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective*, *Chapter 7: Linking*.

<!-- In fact, we are teaching some of CSAPP's amazing contents at our university, and it turns out that students love it. -->

You don't have to be enrolled in our course to use this project. As a contrast, it is designed to be self-explanatory for
learners all over the world (and thus in English). 

Dynamic linking and loading is quite under-documented, and I hope this could make some improvement to it.
